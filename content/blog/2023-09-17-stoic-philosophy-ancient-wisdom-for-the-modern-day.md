Stoicism is not a dry, academic subject; it's a living philosophy designed for the marketplace. Founded by Zeno of Citium and refined by the likes of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, it provides a practical guide for living a good life in any age.

At its core is the Dichotomy of Control: the realization that some things are up to us and some things are not. By focusing our energy solely on what we can control—our thoughts, intentions, and actions—we become invincible to the whims of fortune.

In our modern, chaotic world, this ancient wisdom is more relevant than ever. Whether you're an Agile coach, a developer, or a leader, Stoicism provides the mental armor and the clarity of purpose needed to succeed with integrity and peace of mind.
