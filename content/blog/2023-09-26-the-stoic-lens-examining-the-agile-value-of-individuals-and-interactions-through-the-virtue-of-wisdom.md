Wisdom is the foundational Stoic virtue, defined as the knowledge of what is good, what is bad, and what is indifferent. In Agile, Wisdom is what allows us to navigate the complexity of 'Individuals and Interactions.'

Wisdom teaches us that while we can control our own speech and actions, we cannot control the thoughts or feelings of others. This insight is transformative for team dynamics. It prevents us from getting defensive or aggressive when faced with disagreement. Instead, we approach interactions with curiosity and a desire to understand.

An 'interaction' guided by Wisdom is one that seeks the truth and the best path forward, rather than one that seeks to 'win' an argument. It’s about leveraging the collective intelligence of the team to solve problems that no individual could solve alone.
