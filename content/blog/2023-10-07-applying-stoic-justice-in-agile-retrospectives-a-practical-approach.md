How do we practically apply Stoic Justice in a retrospective? It starts with the intention of the session. A retrospective shouldn't be a post-mortem to find a body; it should be a gathering of peers to improve the collective.

One practical approach is to use 'Circle of Trust' techniques where we explicitly focus on the impact our actions have on the community. Ask: 'How did my work this sprint help or hinder the rest of the team?' This encourages a move away from silos and toward a truly collaborative effort.

Justice also means being fair to ourselves. It means acknowledging the constraints we were working under and not beating ourselves up for things beyond our control. Balance the critique with a fair assessment of effort and intent.
