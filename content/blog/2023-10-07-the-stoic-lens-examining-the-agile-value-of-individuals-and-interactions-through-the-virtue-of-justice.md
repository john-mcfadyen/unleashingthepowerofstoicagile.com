Justice in the Stoic sense is not just about laws and courts; it's about our social duty and how we treat our fellow human beings. When we look at the Agile value of 'Individuals and Interactions' through this lens, we see it as an ethical commitment to the community of the team.

Stoic Justice involves acting for the common good. In an Agile team, this manifests as shared ownership, collective responsibility, and radical transparency. It means ensuring that every voice is heard and that the team's successes and failures are shared equally.

When we treat our interactions as a matter of Justice, we create a high-trust environment where people feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable. This is the foundation upon which great products and great companies are built.
