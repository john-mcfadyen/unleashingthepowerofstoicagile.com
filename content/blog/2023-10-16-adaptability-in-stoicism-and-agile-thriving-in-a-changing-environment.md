Both Stoicism and Agile are therapies for the fear of change. Stoicism teaches us that the universe is in a constant state of flux and that our happiness depends on our ability to flow with that change. Agile, similarly, is built on the principle of 'responding to change over following a plan.'

To thrive in a changing environment, we must embrace what the Stoics call *Amor Fati*—a love of one's fate. This doesn't mean being passive; it means accepting the current reality as the starting point for our next action. When a client changes their mind or a technology becomes obsolete, the Stoic Agile practitioner doesn't lament; they adapt.

This adaptability is the core of resilience. It's the ability to pivot without losing momentum, guided by a clear sense of purpose and a flexible strategy.
