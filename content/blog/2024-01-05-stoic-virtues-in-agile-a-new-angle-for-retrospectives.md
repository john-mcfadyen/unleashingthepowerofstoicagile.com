Retrospectives are the heartbeat of Agile, but all too often they become repetitive or focused solely on technical fixes. By introducing the lens of Stoic virtues, we can breathe new life into these sessions and address the human element of our work.

Imagine a retrospective where instead of just asking 'What went well?' and 'What didn't go well?', we ask:
- **Wisdom**: What did we learn about our process that we didn't know before? Did we focus on the right things?
- **Justice**: Did we support each other as a team? Were our interactions based on fairness and respect?
- **Courage**: Did we have the difficult conversations we needed to have? Were we brave enough to point out risks?
- **Temperance**: Did we maintain a healthy work-life balance? Did we avoid the 'hero culture' trap?

This approach shifts the focus from blame to growth, making retrospectives a true engine of continuous improvement.
