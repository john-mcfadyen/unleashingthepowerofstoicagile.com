The first value of the Agile Manifesto—'Individuals and interactions over processes and tools'—is the most human-centric of all. Stoicism, particularly through the virtue of **Temperance**, provides a profound way to live this value.

Temperance is often described as self-control or moderation. In the context of team interactions, it means listening more than we speak, controlling our impulses to override others, and maintaining a calm demeanor during heated debates. It's about finding the 'Golden Mean' in our communications.

When we apply Temperance to our interactions, we create space for others to contribute. We move away from ego-driven development and toward a collaborative environment where the best ideas can flourish regardless of who they came from. It's the ultimate expression of respecting the individual within the collective.
