Agile leadership is often misunderstood as a lack of control or direction. In reality, it requires a profound level of self-mastery and ethical clarity. This is where the four Stoic virtues—Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance—come into play.

- **Wisdom**: The ability to distinguish between what is within our control and what is not. An Agile leader focuses on creating the right environment for their team rather than micromanaging outcomes.
- **Justice**: Treating every team member with fairness and respect. This aligns perfectly with the Agile value of Individuals and Interactions.
- **Courage**: The bravery to speak the truth, even when it's uncomfortable, and the strength to admit when a change in direction is needed.
- **Temperance**: Maintaining balance and avoiding extremes. Not over-committing the team and ensuring a sustainable pace of work.

By leading with these virtues, you create a culture of trust and high performance that can weather any storm.
